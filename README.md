# Two-Dimensional-N-Body-Simulation-of-the-Triangulum-Galaxy
- Built a two-dimensional N-body simulation of the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) to compare rotation curves generated by visible matter alone versus those including a dark-matter halo.

- Demonstrated that only the dark-matter model reproduces the observed flat outer rotation curve, highlighting the necessity of unseen mass in spiral-galaxy dynamics
